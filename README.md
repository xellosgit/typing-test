#### **Typing Test**

This project is a modern, minimalist typing test application that helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy in English. It provides a real-time interface where users can practice typing predefined quotes and receive immediate feedback on their performance. The app calculates and displays typing speed in **Words Per Minute (WPM)**, accuracy percentage, and the number of mistakes made. The user can switch between a dark and light theme for a comfortable typing experience.
